# NLP on COVID-19 Research Papers

## Perform NLP on COVID-19 research papers to extract useful information.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Find most common words and bigrams in title
    - Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and gensim, visualize with pyLDAvis
    
2. Find similar papers
    - Get embeddings using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and find similar titles using cosine similarity
    
3. Find papers matching query
    - Using cosine similarity & similarity matrix of embeddings

4. Keyword extraction
    - Extact keywords from abstracts using Rake

5. Knowledge graphs
    - Entity detection, dependency parsing, and knowledge graphs from paper abstracts
